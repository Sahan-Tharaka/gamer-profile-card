Gamer Profile Card (React + API)

This project is a small React application created to practice core frontend skills. It uses a public API to load character data and map that data into a custom gamer profile UI.

Features

React component structure with clean props

API fetching with useEffect and useState

Next and Previous buttons to switch between characters

Tailwind CSS for styling

Custom mapping function that turns API data into gamer stats

Dynamic profile card layout

How it works

The app fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API.

A mapping function converts the raw API response into fields that match the gamer profile design.

The GamerProfileCard component displays the final profile.

Next and Previous buttons change the character ID and trigger a new fetch.
